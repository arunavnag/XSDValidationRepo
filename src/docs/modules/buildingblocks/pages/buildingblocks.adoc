[[BuildingBlocks]]
= Building blocks

How cool would it be to give your idea to solve a problem in the industry 4.0 domain a head start? That's exactly what we asked ourselves at Bosch as well and came up with a sophisticated set of software components that not only bridge the gaps between different software but also help building new one.
