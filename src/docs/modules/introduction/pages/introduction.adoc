= Introduction

Modern production depends on its employees. Everyone has their own view of what is most important for their area of responsibility. Quality engineers are interested in the precise adherence to the millimeter of gap dimensions, production managers have the highest possible overall system effectiveness in mind, while material flow planners want to make their transport routes more efficient. Whether it is a detailed view or a meta level: together, all these perspectives are critical for the efficiency of digital production.
What they have in common is that all participants depend on a lean, forward-looking, and connected process that offers orientation and a common basis for added value. The Nexeed Industrial Application System offers both. Building on the Bosch Production System (BPS), it combines lean management with a perspective-oriented bundling of IoT solutions. This way it combines the needs of the individual employee with the overall optimization of manufacturing and intra-logistics.

The areas of use of the Nexeed Industrial Application System are designed for very different user groups. Nevertheless, their essential basic functionalities are located under the user interface and, unnoticed by the user, ensure the three most important properties of a future-oriented IT ecosystem: homogeneity, interoperability, and security, even beyond the digital factory boundaries.
At the same time, this basis is the workshop, control center and library for IT administrators, tailored precisely to their needs. Here they will find all the tools they need to set up an individual Nexeed Industrial Application System tailored to their manufacturing environment: management of master equipment data, the connectivity and integration of different data sources, the configuration of incoming data packages, as well as the assignment of access rights to all users. All functionalities access the same centralized and homogenized data, which avoids redundancies and allows full interoperability between the individual modules. In addition, newly installed modules are directly connected to the database and can be used immediately.
Security comes first and goes hand in hand with user-friendliness. Thanks to the cross-area assignment of access rights, a single login is sufficient so that all authorized users can use and adapt all the modules, functionalities, and data. In addition, the web interface can be individually adapted to the perspective of the individual user. A cross-usage dashboard provides an optimal overview; the quick link to all other functionalities without additional authentications makes daily work easier.

Advantages at a glance:

* Modern, scalable, and expandable software architecture
* Maximum connectivity and flexible configuration
* A common login for all basic functionalities and modules
* Secure access management for different users
* Cross-module master data management
* Integration of different data sources thanks to comprehensive connectivity
